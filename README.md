# Optimal Batting Order through a Markov Chain Genetic Algorithm


This project explores the problem of finding the optimal batting order for the Boston Red Sox. I create a Markov simulation for a baseball game based on real-world statistics, evolving a population of random lineups through a genetic algorithm to find the top-scoring lineup. My analysis shows that the Red Sox lineup can be significantly improved by front-loading on-base-percentage hitters, regardless of slugging percentage, and putting a particular emphasis on double hitting. This paper demonstrates that traditional batting heuristics can be outperformed by statistically optimized orders, and provides a robust batting model which can be extended for real-world use.
